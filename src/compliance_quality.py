"""Compliance quality scoring for compliant model responses.

Measures response substantiveness via token count, lexical diversity (type-token ratio),
and absence of hedge phrases. Produces a 0-1 quality score.

Also provides a fast heuristic pre-filter for obvious refusals and compliance,
used to skip LLM judge calls for clear-cut cases.
